# ircbot-modules
Modules for our IRC bot on Freenode #hackerspacesg

You might have noticed a certain ever-changing presence in the
channel hawking some kind of local food. That would be our pal
[Willie][w], currently *5.3.0*.

Our favourite as of this writing is `WantonMee`. We don't know
what will be recommended next, but it'll be our example here.

Just try to `/msg WantonMee !help` for the details. You should
see a bunch of commands/modules already in use, as listed here
in this README.

Of course, modules may have more than one command with aliases
of each other. For instance, `!ddg` and `!duck`, which both go
to duckduckgo to search for a thing.

You'll see how we've set up each of our modules, so if you are
going to improve or to copy something, feel free to do so :)
